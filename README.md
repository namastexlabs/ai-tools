# AI Tools

This repository contains the source code for the AI Tools that are used in most LLM projects.

We have some Guidelines for the development of tools. These guidelines are based on some famous principles but are more specific for our tools. You can find them [here](docs/project_guidelines.md).

## Creating a new tool

When in need of a new tool, you can use the `create_tool.py` script to generate the necessary files and structure for the tool.

1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the script with Python:

    ```bash
    python .\scripts\create_tool.py
    ```

3. When prompted, enter the desired name for your new tool. The script will generate the necessary files and structure for the tool.
